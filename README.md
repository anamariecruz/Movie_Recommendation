# Movie_Recommendation
This application utilizes a database of IMBd movies and filters through a selection of movies based on input from the user including: choosing a genre versus being recommended a genre, decade(s), rating, minimum and maximum duration, language(s). To create this application, we needed to create a main code containing multiple text blocks that gathered input from the user each time, adding it to a set which was then later when scanning the database for matches based on the user's input. Our program is able to skip over filters if the user so decides. The user may also choose a certain decade and the application will output the most popular genre(s) from that decade (the most frequent genre(s)) or they may skip this and input their own choice of genre(s). This application also provides the oppurtunity for the user to restart the application at the end if they are unsatified with their results or would like to try again.
